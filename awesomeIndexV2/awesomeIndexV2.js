/*
Write a function that takes an array of data in the below format. Assume that this function is run in a browser. It should update a
tag with id="awesome-index" with the average awesome-index of all programmers. Your solution should continue to work even if more people are added to the array. Write two versions, one using lodash (or underscore) and jQuery, and one using only Javascript utilities native to the browser. *
